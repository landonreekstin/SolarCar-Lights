# SolarCar-Lights

Controls 3 seperate light modules for front, rear, and canopy lights on the Principia RaXI solar car. Takes inputs from the steering wheel and driver control panel and communicates over CAN to the lighting modules. Upon receiving commands, lighting modules control the turn signals, running lights, brake lights, and canopy strobe.

This project is a copy from the private Principia Solar Car repository and excludes library and include files for privacy. I contributed alongside two other developers in coding, debugging, and testing this project.

The project uses the PIO and Arduino libraries to control a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller.
